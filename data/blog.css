A Path less <s>traveled</s> talked about|ErdMutter92|Feb. 5 2015|<p>I wanted to take some time and write about some of my experiences over the years. When I was just a kid I took an interest in Web Site development thanks to my mother. From there I started learning about creating my own website, which enevitably lead me to programming thanks to JavaScript. It\'s strange looking back on it now, but if it was not for my mother\'s or brother\'s interest in computers and what they can do I would not be where I am today. I owe it to them for being an insperating which lead to a hobby the I love.</p>
