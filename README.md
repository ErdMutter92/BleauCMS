<h1>BleauCMS</h1>
A blog style project of sorts, where you are able to edit pages. Pages are a single article with it's own menus. Trying to go for an old school feel of pages with links to more pages. Currently undergoing heavy development. This is just something for me to putz around with in my bordem.

<h2>Under Development</h2>
Being as this is a new project, and that I am not sure what direction I want to take... everything is under development and could be completely rewritten at any time. xD
